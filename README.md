# Beegmac
a Brapi-Enabled Embeddable Genomic-Marker Allele Client

#### Beegmac is a HTML / Javascript client for the __Breeding API__ (https://www.brapi.org)

It focuses on the part of BrAPI that deals with genotyping data and therefore requires server implementations to implement the following calls in compliance with v1.1:

-	/calls
-	/allelematrix-search
-	/allelematrix-search/status/maps
-	/markerprofiles
-	/markers-search
-	/studies-search
